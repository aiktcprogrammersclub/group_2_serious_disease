are the health
hazards of exposure to asbestos?</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">People may be
exposed to asbestos in their workplace, their communities, or their
homes. If products containing asbestos are disturbed,  tiny asbestos fibers are
released into the air. When asbestos fibers are breathed in, they may
get trapped in the lungs and remain there &nbsp;for a long time.
Over time, these fibers can accumulate and cause scarring and
inflammation which can affect breathing and lead to serious  &nbsp;health
problems.Asbestos has been classified as a known human carcinogen (a
substance that causes cancer) by the U.S. Department of Health and  &nbsp;Human Services,
the EPA, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (Studies
have shown that exposure to asbestos may increase the risk &nbsp;of lung cancer and
mesothelioma (a relatively rare cancer of the&nbsp; thin&nbsp;membranes&nbsp;that
line the chest and&nbsp;abdomen) 
thin&nbsp;membranes&nbsp;that line the chest
and&nbsp;abdomen). Although rare, mesothelioma &nbsp;is the most common
form of cancer associated with asbestos exposure. In addition to lung
cancer and mesothelioma, some studies have suggested  &nbsp;an association
between asbestos exposure
and&nbsp;gastrointestinal&nbsp;and&nbsp;colorectalcancers,
as well as an elevated risk for cancers of the&nbsp;throat, </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">&nbsp;kidney,&nbsp;esophagus,
and&nbsp;gallbladder. However, the evidence is inconclusive.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; font-size:40px;">Why
is there concern
that hair dyes may cause cancer?</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">Many people in the
United States and Europe use hair dyes. It is estimated that more than
one-third of women over age 18 and about 10 percent of  men over age 40 use some
type of hair dye . Over 5,000 different chemicals are used in hair dye
products, some of which are reported to be  carcinogenic
(cancer-causing) in animals . Because so many people use hair dyes,
scientists have tried to determine whether exposure to the  chemicals in hair coloring
products is associated with an increased risk of cancer in people.  Early hair dye formulations
contained chemicals, including aromatic amines that were found to cause
cancer in animals. In the mid- to late 1970s,  however, manufacturers
changed the components in dye products to eliminate some of these
chemicals. It is not known whether some of the chemicals  still used in hair dyes can
cause cancer. Given the widespread use of hair dye products, even a
small increase in risk may have a considerable  public health impact.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">Although some
studies have linked the personal use of hair dyes with increased risks
of certain cancers of the blood and bone marrow,  such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL) and&nbsp;leukemia.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold; font-size:40px;">Does
acrylamide
increase the risk of cancer?</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">Studies in rodent
models have found that acrylamide exposure poses a risk for several
types of cancer. However, the evidence from human studies  is still incomplete. The
National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research
on Cancer consider acrylamide to be a &#8220;probable  human carcinogen,&#8221; based on
studies in laboratory animals given acrylamide in drinking water.
However, toxicology studies have shown differences  in acrylamide absorption
rates between humans and rodents.  To avoid such limitations
in accurately determining acrylamide exposure, biomarkers of exposure
were recently used in a Danish cohort study  designed to evaluate the
subsequent risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Among women
with higher levels of acrylamide bound </span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">to the hemoglobin in
their blood, there was a statistically significant increase in risk of
estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  This finding suggests an
endocrine hormone-related effect, which would be consistent with the
results of a questionnaire-based cohort  study in the Netherlands
that found an excess of endometrial and ovarian cancer&#8212;but not of
postmenopausal breast cancer&#8212;associated with  higher levels of acrylamide
exposure. Another cohort study from the Netherlands suggested a
positive association between dietary  acrylamide and the risk of
renal cell cancer, but not of prostate or bladder cancer.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">

many experiments, rodents fed a diet </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">supplemented with HCAs
developed tumors of the breast, colon, liver, skin, lung, prostate, and
other organs. Rodents fed PAHs </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">also developed
cancers, including leukemia and tumors of the gastrointestinal tract
and lungs. However, the doses of HCAs and PAHs</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">used in these
studies were very high&#8212;equivalent to thousands of times the doses that
a person would consume in a normal diet.</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">Nevertheless,
numerous epidemiologic studies have used detailed questionnaires to
examine participants&#8217; meat consumption and meat cooking </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">methods to estimate
HCA and PAH exposures. Researchers found that high consumption of
well-done, fried, or barbecued meats was associated </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0); font-size:18px; ">with increased risks
of colorectal , pancreatic, and prostate cancer.</span><br style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">
