<big style="font-weight: bold;">What
causes&nbsp;diabetes?</big><br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What causes type 1
diabetes?</span><br>
Type 1 diabetes is caused by a lack of insulin due to the destruction
of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In type 1 diabetes&#8212;an
autoimmune disease&#8212;the body&#8217;s immune system attacks and destroys the
beta cells. Normally, the immune system protects the body from
infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other
potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the
immune system attacks the body&#8217;s own cells. In type 1 diabetes, beta
cell destruction may take place over several years, but symptoms of the
disease usually develop over a short period of time. Type 1 diabetes
typically occurs in children and young adults, though
it can appear at any age. In the past, type 1 diabetes was called
juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Latent
autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) may be a slowly developing
kind of type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis usually occurs after age 30. In
LADA, as in type 1 diabetes, the body&#8217;s immune system destroys the beta
cells. At the time of diagnosis, people with LADA may still produce
their own insulin, but eventually most will need insulin shots or an
insulin pump to control blood glucose levels.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Genetic Susceptibility</span><br>
Heredity plays an important part in determining who is likely to
develop type 1 diabetes. Genes are passed down from biological parent
to child. Genes carry instructions for making proteins that are needed
for the body&#8217;s cells to function. Many genes, as well as interactions
among genes, are thought to influence susceptibility to and protection
from type 1 diabetes. The key genes may vary in different population
groups. Variations in genes that affect more than 1 percent of a
population group are called gene variants.<br>
Certain gene variants that carry instructions for making proteins
called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) on white blood cells are linked
to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The proteins produced by HLA
genes help determine whether the immune system recognizes a cell as
part of the body or as foreign material. Some combinations of HLA gene
variants predict that a person will be at higher risk for type 1
diabetes, while other combinations are protective or have no effect on
risk.<br>
While HLA genes are the major risk genes for type 1 diabetes, many
additional risk genes or gene regions have been found. Not only can
these genes help identify people at risk for type 1 diabetes, but they
also provide important clues to help scientists better understand how
the disease develops and identify potential targets for therapy and
prevention.<br>
Genetic testing can show what types of HLA genes a person carries and
can reveal other genes linked to diabetes. However, most genetic
testing is done in a research setting and is not yet available to
individuals. Scientists are studying how the results of genetic testing
can be used to improve type 1 diabetes prevention or treatment.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Autoimmune Destruction of Beta Cells</span><br>
In type 1 diabetes, white blood cells called T cells attack and destroy
beta cells. The process begins well before diabetes symptoms appear and
continues after diagnosis. Often, type 1 diabetes is not diagnosed
until most beta cells have already been destroyed. At this point, a
person needs daily insulin treatment to survive. Finding ways to modify
or stop this autoimmune process and preserve beta cell function is a
major focus of current scientific research.<br>
Recent research suggests insulin itself may be a key trigger of the
immune attack on beta cells. The immune systems of people who are
susceptible to developing type 1 diabetes respond to insulin as if it
were a foreign substance, or antigen. To combat antigens, the body
makes proteins called antibodies. Antibodies to insulin and other
proteins produced by beta cells are found in people with type 1
diabetes. Researchers test for these antibodies to help identify people
at increased risk of developing the disease. Testing the types and
levels of antibodies in the blood can help determine whether a person
has type 1 diabetes, LADA, or another type of diabetes.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Environmental Factors</span><br>
Environmental factors, such as foods, viruses, and toxins, may play a
role in the development of type 1 diabetes, but the exact nature of
their role has not been determined. Some theories suggest that
environmental factors trigger the autoimmune destruction of beta cells
in people with a genetic susceptibility to diabetes. Other theories
suggest that environmental factors play an ongoing role in diabetes,
even after diagnosis.<br>
Viruses and infections. A virus cannot cause diabetes on its own, but
people are sometimes diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during or after a
viral infection, suggesting a link between the two. Also, the onset of
type 1 diabetes occurs more frequently during the winter when viral
infections are more common. Viruses possibly associated with type 1
diabetes include coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus,
rubella, and mumps. Scientists have described several ways these
viruses may damage or destroy beta cells or possibly trigger an
autoimmune response in susceptible people. For example, anti-islet
antibodies have been found in patients with congenital rubella
syndrome, and cytomegalovirus has been associated with significant beta
cell damage and acute pancreatitis&#8211;&#8211;inflammation of the pancreas.
Scientists are trying to identify a virus that can cause type 1
diabetes so that a vaccine might be developed to prevent the disease.<br>
Infant feeding practices. Some studies have suggested that dietary
factors may raise or lower the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. For
example, breastfed infants and infants receiving vitamin D supplements
may have a reduced risk of developing type 1 diabetes, while early
exposure to cow&#8217;s milk and cereal proteins may increase risk. More
research is needed to clarify how infant nutrition affects the risk for
type 1 diabetes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What causes type 2
diabetes?</span><br>
Type 2 diabetes&#8212;the most common form of diabetes&#8212;is caused by a
combination of factors, including insulin resistance, a condition in
which the body&#8217;s muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin
effectively. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can no longer
produce enough insulin to compensate for the impaired ability to use
insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes may develop gradually and can be
subtle; some people with type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed for years.<br>
Type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people who
are also overweight or obese. The disease, once rare in youth, is
becoming more common in overweight and obese children and adolescents.
Scientists think genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are
the most likely triggers of type 2 diabetes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Genetic Susceptibility</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
Genes play a significant part in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes.
Having certain genes or combinations of genes may increase or decrease
a person&#8217;s risk for developing the disease. The role of genes is
suggested by the high rate of type 2 diabetes in families and identical
twins and wide variations in diabetes prevalence by ethnicity. Type 2
diabetes occurs more frequently in African Americans, Alaska Natives,
American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, and some Asian Americans, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islander Americans than it does in non-Hispanic
whites.<br>
Recent studies have combined genetic data from large numbers of people,
accelerating the pace of gene discovery. Though scientists have now
identified many gene variants that increase susceptibility to type 2
diabetes, the majority have yet to be discovered. The known genes
appear to affect insulin production rather than insulin resistance.
Researchers are working to identify additional gene variants and to
learn how they interact with one another and with environmental factors
to cause diabetes.<br>
Studies have shown that variants of the TCF7L2 gene increase
susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For people who inherit two copies of
the variants, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes is about 80
percent higher than for those who do not carry the gene variant.1
However, even in those with the variant, diet and physical activity
leading to weight loss help delay diabetes, according to the Diabetes
Prevention Program (DPP), a major clinical trial involving people at
high risk.<br>
Genes can also increase the risk of diabetes by increasing a person&#8217;s
tendency to become overweight or obese. One theory, known as the
&#8220;thrifty gene&#8221; hypothesis, suggests certain genes increase the
efficiency of metabolism to extract energy from food and store the
energy for later use. This survival trait was advantageous for
populations whose food supplies were scarce or unpredictable and could
help keep people alive during famine. In modern times, however, when
high-calorie foods are plentiful, such a trait can promote obesity and
type 2 diabetes.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Obesity and Physical
Inactivity</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
Physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the
development of type 2 diabetes. People who are genetically susceptible
to type 2 diabetes are more vulnerable when these risk factors are
present. An imbalance between caloric intake and physical activity can
lead to
obesity, which causes insulin resistance and is common in people with
type 2 diabetes. Central obesity, in which a person has excess
abdominal fat, is a major risk factor not only for insulin resistance
and type 2 diabetes but also for heart and blood vessel disease, also
called cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess &#8220;belly fat&#8221; produces
hormones and other substances that can cause harmful, chronic effects
in the body such as damage to blood vessels.<br>
The DPP and other studies show that millions of people can lower their
risk for type 2 diabetes by making lifestyle changes and losing weight.
The DPP proved that people with prediabetes&#8212;at high risk of developing
type 2 diabetes&#8212;could sharply lower their risk by losing weight through
regular physical activity and a diet low in fat and calories.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Insulin Resistance</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
Insulin resistance is a common condition in people who are overweight
or obese, have excess abdominal fat, and are not physically active.
Muscle, fat, and liver cells stop responding properly to insulin,
forcing the pancreas to compensate by producing extra insulin. As long
as beta cells are able to produce enough insulin, blood glucose levels
stay in the normal range. But when insulin production falters because
of beta cell dysfunction, glucose levels rise, leading to prediabetes
or diabetes.<br>
Abnormal Glucose Production by the Liver<br>
In some people with diabetes, an abnormal increase in glucose
production by the liver also contributes to high blood glucose levels.
Normally, the pancreas releases the hormone glucagon when blood glucose
and insulin levels are low. Glucagon stimulates the liver to produce
glucose and release it into the bloodstream. But when blood glucose and
insulin levels are high after a meal, glucagon levels drop, and the
liver stores excess glucose for later, when it is needed. For reasons
not completely understood, in many people with diabetes, glucagon
levels stay higher than needed. High glucagon levels cause the liver to
produce unneeded glucose, which contributes to high blood glucose
levels. Metformin, the most commonly used drug to treat type 2
diabetes, reduces glucose production by the liver.<br>
The Roles of Insulin and Glucagon in Normal Blood Glucose Regulation<br>
A healthy person&#8217;s body keeps blood glucose levels in a normal range
through several complex mechanisms. Insulin and glucagon, two hormones
made in the pancreas, help regulate blood glucose levels:<br>
<ul>
<li>Insulin, made by beta cells, lowers elevated blood glucose
levels.</li>
<li>Glucagon, made by alpha cells, raises low blood glucose
levels.</li>
<li>When blood glucose levels rise after a meal, the pancreas
releases
insulin into the blood.</li>
<li>Insulin helps muscle, fat, and liver cells absorb glucose
from the
bloodstream, lowering blood glucose levels.</li>
<li>Insulin stimulates the liver and muscle tissue to store
excess glucose.
The stored form of glucose is called glycogen.</li>
<li>Insulin also lowers blood glucose levels by reducing
glucose production
in the liver.</li>
<li>When blood glucose levels drop overnight or due to a
skipped meal or
heavy exercise, the pancreas releases glucagon into the blood.</li>
<li>Glucagon signals the liver and muscle tissue to break down
glycogen
into glucose, which enters the bloodstream and raises blood glucose
levels.</li>
<li>If the body needs more glucose, glucagon stimulates the
liver to make
glucose from amino acids.</li>

Insulin and glucagon help regulate blood <br>
glucose levels.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Metabolic Syndrome</span><br>
Metabolic syndrome, also called insulin resistance syndrome, refers to
a group of conditions common in people with insulin resistance,
including higher than normal blood glucose levelsincreased waist size
due to excess abdominal fat high blood pressure abnormal levels of
cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.<br>
People with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of developing
type 2 diabetes and CVD. Many studies have found that lifestyle
changes, such as being physically active and losing excess weight, are
the best ways to reverse metabolic syndrome, improve the body&#8217;s
response to insulin, and reduce risk for type 2 diabetes and CVD.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cell Signaling and
Regulation</span><br>
Cells communicate through a complex network of molecular signaling
pathways. For example, on cell surfaces, insulin receptor molecules
capture, or bind, insulin molecules circulating in the bloodstream.
This interaction between insulin and its receptor prompts the
biochemical signals that enable the cells to absorb glucose from the
blood and use it for energy.<br>
Problems in cell signaling systems can set off a chain reaction that
leads to diabetes or other diseases. Many studies have focused on how
insulin signals cells to communicate and regulate action. Researchers
have identified proteins and pathways that transmit the insulin signal
and have mapped interactions between insulin and body tissues,
including the way insulin helps the liver control blood glucose levels.
Researchers have also found that key signals also come from fat cells,
which produce substances that cause inflammation and insulin resistance.<br>
This work holds the key to combating insulin resistance and diabetes.
As scientists learn more about cell signaling systems involved in
glucose regulation, they will have more opportunities to develop
effective treatments.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Beta Cell Dysfunction</span><br>
Scientists think beta cell dysfunction is a key contributor to type 2
diabetes. Beta cell impairment can cause inadequate or abnormal
patterns of insulin release. Also, beta cells may be damaged by high
blood glucose itself, a condition called glucose toxicity.<br>
Scientists have not determined the causes of beta cell dysfunction in
most cases. Single gene defects lead to specific forms of diabetes
called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The genes involved
regulate insulin production in the beta cells. Although these forms of
diabetes are rare, they provide clues as to how beta cell function may
be affected by key regulatory factors. Other gene variants are involved
in determining the number and function of beta cells. But these
variants account for only a small percentage of type 2 diabetes cases.
Malnutrition early in life is also being investigated as a cause of
beta cell dysfunction. The metabolic environment of the developing
fetus may also create a predisposition for diabetes later in life.<br>
