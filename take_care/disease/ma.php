Asthma medications are generally considered to fall into two classes:
bronchodilators, which stop asthma attacks after they've started and
help prevent attacks, and anti-inflammatories, which control the airway
inflammation and prevent asthma attacks from starting.<br>
Although these medicines come in several brand names and various forms
such as sprays, pills, powders, liquids and shots, your physician will
determine the one which is best for you.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Bronchodilators</span><br>
Bronchodilators provide relief during an asthma attack. They relax
muscles in your air tubes, forcing them to open up and allowing you to
breathe. Bronchodilators also may help clear mucus from the lungs,
allowing it to move more freely and be more easily coughed out.<br>
Some examples of bronchodilators include short-acting beta-agonists
(usually used to prevent exercise-induced asthma), anticholinergics
(usually used in addition to or as an alternative to short-acting
beta-agonists, and theophylline (a long-acting drug used to treat
difficult-to-control or severe asthma).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Anti-Inflammatories</span><br>
Anti-inflammatories prevent asthma attacks by keeping air tubes open
all of the time. They are designed to reduce swelling in the air tubes
and decrease the amount of mucus. Cromolyn and nedocromil are two
examples of anti-inflammatory medicines.<br>
Corticosteroids are the most popular class of anti-inflammatories and
are the drug of choice for persistent asthma. Other anti-inflammatories
include mast cell stabilizers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Side Effects</span><br>
There is always a risk of side effects associated with taking medicine.
These may include sore throat, nervousness, nausea, rapid heartbeat,
loss of appetite, or staying awake. A doctor may need to modify your
treatment plan if side effects become severe.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Allergy-related</span><br>
Asthma sufferers with allergies may receive hyposensitization therapy
or allergy shots. The shots may help prevent asthma attacks, but
experts do not agree about their usefulness.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Over-The-Counter</span><br>
Over-the-counter asthma drugs such as "Primatene Mist" and "Bronkaid"
are widely available bronchodilators that provide short term relief.
These medicines, however, do not control long-term asthma and should
not be used every day to relieve asthma symptoms. Check with a
physician before using over-the-counter medicines.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Metered-Dose Inhalers</span><br>
The most common device used to deliver medicine to the lungs of
asthmatics is the metered-dose inhaler. Inhalers have two parts: 1) a
canister consisting of a propellant, the medicine, and stabilizers, and
2) an actuator or mouthpiece consisting of a discharge nozzle and a
dust cap. Inhalers are easily used by pressing down the top of the
canister and inhaling the gas that is released. Usually the medicine
administered by metered-dose inhalers is a bronchodilator,
corticosteroid, or a mast cell stabilizer.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Dry Powder Inhalers</span><br>
As an alternative to the aerosol-based metered-dose inhalers, dry
powder inhalers deliver medicine from a capsule in powder form. These
devices require the patient to inhale forcefully to pull the powder
from the device into the lungs and can be more complicated to use than
metered-dose inhalers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nebulizer</span><br>
Medication may also be administered using a nebulizer, providing a
larger, continuous dose. Nebulizers vaporize a dose of medication in a
saline solution into a steady stream of foggy vapor that is inhaled by
the patient. Nebulizers are more common in hospital settings for
patients who have difficulty using a metered-dose inhaler.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Asthma Spacer</span><br>
Asthma spacers are attachments that can be added to metered-dose
inhalers. The spacer goes between the patient's mouth and the
mouthpiece of the inhaler, and it acts as a reservoir that briefly
holds the medication. Spacers allow a patient to inhale the medicine
without having to coordinate the breathing and mechanical actions
needed to use an inhaler. Spacers also help patients deliver the
medication directly to the lungs, avoiding medicine on the side of the
mouth and the condition known as "thrush".</div>
