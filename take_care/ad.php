How costly is diabetes management and treatment?</span><br>
Diabetes management and treatment is expensive. According to the
American Diabetes Association (ADA), the average cost of health care
for a person with diabetes is $13,741 a year&#8212;more than twice the cost
of health care for a person without diabetes. Many people who have
diabetes need help paying for their care. For
those who qualify, a variety of government and nongovernment programs
can help cover health care expenses. This publication is meant to help
people with diabetes and their family members find and access such
resources.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:30px; color:green;">What is health insurance?</span><br>
Health insurance helps pay for medical care, including the cost of
diabetes care. Health insurance options include the following:<br>
private health insurance, which includes group and individual health
insurance<br>
government health insurance, such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Children&#8217;s
Health Insurance Program (CHIP), TRICARE, and veterans&#8217; health care
programs<br>
Starting in 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) prevents insurers from
denying coverage or charging higher premiums to people with preexisting
conditions, such as diabetes. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:30px; color:green;">What is private health
insurance?</span><br>
Insurance companies sell private health insurance plans. Two types of
private health insurance are Group health insurance. People may be
eligible to purchase group health
insurance through their employer or union or through a family member&#8217;s
employer or union. Other organizations, such as professional or alumni
organizations, may also offer group health insurance.<br>
Individual health insurance. People may purchase individual health
insurance for themselves and their families. The website HealthCare.gov
provides information about individual insurance plans. The website also
provides a search function, called the Health Insurance Marketplace, to
find health insurance options by state. Depending on their income and
family size, some people may qualify for lower-cost premiums through
the Health Insurance Marketplace. People can select or change
individual health insurance plans during the open enrollment period
each year. HealthCare.gov lists open enrollment period dates. The
website also provides information about life events that may allow
people to enroll outside the open enrollment period.<br>
Employers may have a waiting period before an employee and his or her
family members can enroll in the company health plan. Under the ACA,
the waiting period can be no longer than 90 days. Certain health plans
called health maintenance organizations (HMOs) may have an affiliation
period&#8212;a time that must pass before health insurance coverage becomes
effective. An affiliation period can be no longer than 3 months.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size:30px; color:green;">What is Medicare?</span><br>
Medicare is a federal health insurance program that pays health care
costs for eligible people who are<br>
age 65 or older<br>
under age 65 with certain disabilities<br>
of any age with end-stage renal disease&#8212;total and permanent kidney
failure that requires a kidney transplant or blood-filtering treatments
called dialysis<br>
What health plans does Medicare offer?<br>
Medicare has four parts:<br>
<ul>
<li>Part A (hospital insurance) covers inpatient care, skilled
nursing home
residence, hospice care, and home health care. Part A has no premium
for those who have paid enough Medicare taxes. A premium is an amount a
person must pay periodically&#8212;monthly or quarterly&#8212;for Medicare, other
health plan, or drug plan coverage. Part A does have a deductible, an
amount a person must pay for health care or prescriptions before the
health plan will pay. A person must pay a daily amount for hospital
stays that last longer than 60 days.</li>
<li>Part B (medical insurance) covers services from health care
providers,
outpatient care, home health care, durable medical equipment, and some
preventative services. Part B has a monthly premium based on a person&#8217;s
income. Rates change each year. After a person pays the deductible each
year, Part B pays 80 percent for most covered services as a primary
payer. The billing staff of the service provider&#8212;hospital or clinic&#8212;can
calculate how much a person will owe.</li>
<li>Part C (Medicare Advantage Plans) are part of Medicare and
are
sometimes called MA Plans. Medicare must approve Medicare Advantage
Plans. Each Medicare Advantage Plan must cover Part A and Part B
services and may cover other services, too. </li>
<li>Medicare Advantage Plans
may have Part D prescription coverage. If not, a person can buy a Part
D plan separately. Medicare Advantage Plans are not all the same. A
person who is thinking of choosing a Medicare Advantage Plan should ask
about the rules of the plan. The rules may specify which health care
providers or hospitals a person may use. The plan may require a
referral from a primary care provider to see a specialist. The plan may
not cover medical expenses incurred during travel. How much a person
has to pay out-of-pocket each year will vary by plan. People who have a
Medicare Advantage Plan cannot have a Medigap plan to help pay
out&#8209;of-pocket costs. See the section on Medigap.</li>
</ul>

risk of developing diabetes ,diabetes self-management training diabetes

details about how the plan provides the diabetes services, supplies,
and medications covered by Medicare.<br>
